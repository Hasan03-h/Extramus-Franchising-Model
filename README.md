📌 Extramus – Franchise & Partnership Project
📝 Project Description

This project explored the financial and strategic feasibility of expanding Extramus, a nonprofit internship mobility organization in Italy.

Originally designed as a franchising model, the project later pivoted into a partnership model, where Extramus acts as a middleman between companies seeking interns and students seeking internships.

My role as Finance Intern focused on building financial models, KPIs, and scenario analyses to test the sustainability of both approaches.

🎯 My Contributions

Designed income statements for both franchisor and franchisee.

Conducted break-even analysis (estimated 8 interns needed to cover costs).

Built scenario analysis (Best–Moderate–Worst cases).

KPI Development & Visualization

Created 3 KPI sets: Operational, Financial, and Impact.

Visualized results using Tableau dashboards.

Pricing & Revenue Strategy
